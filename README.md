# Matrix Calculator & WiFi Signal Logger Android Projects

Welcome! This repository contains **two different Android projects**, separated into different Git branches.

| Branch Name        | Project Description                                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `matrix-calculator` | Android app to perform matrix operations using C++ native code and vector library |
| `wifi-signal-logger`| Android app to log WiFi signal strengths across multiple locations                |

## üìú How to Access Each Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Guneet-Pal-Singh/MatrixCal-WifiRSSI
   cd MatrixCal-WifiRSSI
   ```

2. Checkout the branch you need:

   - Matrix Calculator:
     ```bash
     git checkout matrix-calculator
     ```

   - WiFi Signal Logger:
     ```bash
     git checkout wifi-signal-logger
     ```

Each branch has its own fully independent Android app with its own README.

## ‚ú® Project Summary

### Matrix Calculator (Branch: `matrix-calculator`)
- Input two matrices of any dimensions.
- Perform Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Element-wise Division.
- Matrix operations are implemented in **C++ using Eigen** (or similar) via **JNI**.

### WiFi Signal Logger (Branch: `wifi-signal-logger`)
- Scan and log WiFi RSSI (signal strength) values.
- Collect 100 samples per location.
- Distinguish and show data from **at least three different locations**.
